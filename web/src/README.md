# Folder structure
> I've kept the folder structure clean and simple to use.

- Their are `app`, `pages` and `shared` folders.
- Everything in the shared folder is common to other folders and they can use codes from it.
- app consists of main setup of the react app like routes, css config and redux states initialization.
- pages consist of well you guessed it pages on the website.
